## openstreetmap 查找节点
If it's a polygon, then it's a closed way in the OSM database. You can find ways by id as simple as this: http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/305293190

If a specific node (the building blocks of ways) is giving a problem, the link would be http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/305293190 .

If it is a multipolygon (for example a building with a hole in it), the link would be http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/305293190
